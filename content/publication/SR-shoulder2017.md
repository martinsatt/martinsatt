abstract = "We investigated the effectiveness of conservative interventions for pain, function and range of motion in adults with shoulder impingement with a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials. Although there was only very low quality evidence, exercise should be considered for patients with shoulder impingement symptoms and tape, ECSWT, laser or manual therapy might be added. NSAIDS and corticosteroids are superior to placebo, but it is unclear how these treatments compare to exercise."
