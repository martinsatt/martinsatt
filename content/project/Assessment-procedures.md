Practical procedures are a core component in physiotherapy education. In order to determine if a student has an adequate level of procedural competency educators need a valid and reliable way of determining this. Assessment tools can be used to evaluate individual students. Accrediting bodies could use these assessment tools to compare performance of skill competence across different physiotherapy programmes. Lastly, evidence is available that assessment tools can facilitate learning of practical procedures. 
The aim of this project was to i) synthesise relevant literature systematically to produce a review or conceptual analysis of current knowledge of assessments for procedural skills in physiotherapy education, 2) develop a preliminary assessment for the evaluation of procedural skills in physiotherapy education and 3) evaluate and critical appraise the measurement properties of the assessment for procedural skills in physiotherapy education.
